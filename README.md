Hi.

This is my Ferriswheel Frontend Practical Exercise.

To install and use it do the following:

> yarn (or npm install)

> yarn start (or npm start)

That's all for development mode of app.

If you want to build it for production version do:

> yarn (or npm install)

> yarn build (or npm run build)


Then publish it to your web server and use it or run it locally with serve:

> yarn global add serve (or npm install -g serve)

> serve -s build

It's created with create-react-app so if you're familiar with it, there won't be any surprises, at least with running it.
